🎈 <strong>ABOUT ME</strong>

Hi, I'm Monday — a data analyst with a focus on clarity and impact. I use SQL, Excel, Power BI, and Python to solve real business problems — from cleaning messy data to answering complex questions and building dashboards that support better decisions.

With a background in economics and practical experience from IBM’s Data Analyst program, I bring both technical skill and business thinking to every project.

This portfolio showcases how I’ve helped teams and clients:

- Make sense of large, messy datasets  
- Uncover trends and translate them into action  
- Build tools and visuals that inform decision-makers

If you're a recruiter, business owner, or client looking for clear, insight-driven analytics — welcome. Let’s dive in.
